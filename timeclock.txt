To do:
* get active employees
* pay period reports
* adding an employee: list not refreshed? problem is random

Done:
* empty pin should throw error (temp fix: disabled Enter on empty pin)
* time editing: in h:mm format (and others)
* time editing: deleting entries at end should shorten array
* keypad allows only active employees
* employee resource; eliminated dependency on $http
